- Howdy everyone.
Welcome to your
10 minute stretch.
Thank you for
joining me and Benji, of course.
We're gonna start on all fours.
So come on down to the ground.
Spread the fingertips wide,
wrists underneath
the shoulders,
knees directly
underneath the hips.
On an inhale,
drop your belly,
open your chest.
Take it nice and slow here.
Lengthen through the crown of
the head and imagine your tail
really reaching
up towards the sky.
Good, breathe in.
Exhale, press into
your yoga mat
or the earth and
round through the spine.
Again, pause, take it slow here.
Feel the stretch
of the back body.
Hug the low rib into the spine.
Draw your navel up, up, up.
And now let it flow.
Inhale, dropping the belly, 
Cow Pose.
Exhale, rounding through Cat.
You can close your eyes here.
Start to drop in 
to conscious breath
as we practice
some conscious stretching.
And the next time you're
in Cat Pose, stay there.
Draw the low ribs in towards
your back a little more so
you feel more of a stretch.
And then you're gonna 
bump your hips to the left
while you're in 
this Cat Pose and
then turn your gaze
over to your left hip crease.
Great, then come
through Cat Pose.
This is a little different than
the side stretch we've
done a lot in the past.
You're gonna remain in Cat,
arching the back,
bump the hips to the right
and now turn to look
to your right hip.
You should feel this
length in the left low back.
Lovely, now come back to center,
curl the toes under,
send the hips back but just
reach the fingertips forward.
Tent the palms,
so you're lifting the palms up
and we're stretching 
the wrists forward
and the fascia of 
the feet, the ankles.
Find a little traction here.
You can even drop the chin
down if it feels all right here.
And then slowly lift the
heart up, plant the palms.
Keep the toes curled under
as we send the hips back
for Downward Facing Dog.
Stretch it out here,
relax the head,
bend one knee
and then the other.
Just pedal it out here again,
bringing conscious breath to the
conscious stretching.
Press into the 
index finger and thumb here.
Feel the
upper arm bones rotate out,
left to right externally.
And then see if you can hug
those low ribs in once again,
so we're not just
dumping through the front body,
but we're finding
a little engagement.
Nice, then anchor
the left heel down.
Inhale, lift the right
leg up high, Three-Legged Dog.
Exhale, point the toes.
And then slowly shift it
forward and step that
right foot all the way
up into a low lunge.
You can lower the back knee.
Front knee over front ankle
and let's take a breath here.
If you want a
little more stretch here,
you can curl the left toes
under just to walk the
left knee out and then everyone
come onto the top of that
left foot for this stretch.
Pull the right hip crease back.
Close your eyes here 
if you feel comfortable
or find a soft gaze and breathe.
Alright, this is the first stop.
You can stay here breathing.
Try to get lighter
on your fingertips.
We can also
interlace the fingertips,
bring them to the
top of the thigh.
Everyone lift up just a
bit between the thighs.
So squeeze your thighs
in towards the midline.
Find that lift
from the pelvic floor.
And then last stop,
reach the fingertips
forward, up and back.
Big breath,
big stretch here,
Crescent Lunge.
Everyone press into
the top of that back foot.
Try to keep those 
back toes straight and in line
as best you can with your ankle.
Lovely, then wiggle the
fingertips, rain it down.
We'll all meet here.
Plant the palms,
curl the toes under,
lift the back knee 
and step it back,
Downward Facing Dog.
Anchor the right heel,
inhale,
lift the left leg up high.
Exhale, shift it forward.
Step your left foot up
into that nice low lunge.
You can use blocks here.
Stack the front knee
over the front ankle.
And if you want
a deeper stretch,
you can curl the toes under,
walk the right knee back,
and then press into
the top of that left foot.
So imagine the root of this
stretch is coming
from your left,
excuse me, your right foot,
pressing down firmly.
That's how you're gonna
find that deep, deep stretch.
Then stay here, maybe get
lighter on the fingertips.
So engage your core muscles.
Or we can
interlace the fingertips,
come to the left thigh,
take a breath here,
lift your heart.
Everyone squeeze
the inner thighs
to the midline just to lift up.
Also engages the glutes.
And then maybe we take
it full Crescent Lunge.
Now moving in this shape,
think about really
stretching fingertips up,
pressing into the
top of that back foot,
pressing into the
left big toe mound,
finding extension in the neck.
And then we'll
wiggle the fingertips
and rain it all the way down.
From here, back to
Downward Facing Dog.
Peace out, Benji.
Take a deep breath in.
And a long breath out.
One more time, big breath in.
And a long breath out.
Slowly lower the knees.
Listen carefully, you're gonna 
drop the elbows down.
And then from here,
press into the palms,
forearms are parallel.
You're gonna walk the
knees back to Puppy Pose.
So deep stretch here.
Melting the heart
towards the earth,
pressing into the palms.
Maybe the forehead 
comes to the mat.
Tailbone up towards the sky.
Breathe into
the shoulder girdle.
Breathe into the
ribcage and the low back.
Notice if you're gripping around
your forehead or your jaw,
or the fingers or the toes,
soften there.
And then slowly carve a
line with the nose, look up.
We'll come all the
way up with the knees.
So you're walking
the knees all the way up
towards the front of your mat.
Swing your legs to one side.
And then you're gonna
hug the right knee in
as you extend
the left leg out long.
Sit up nice and tall here, 
inhale.
Exhale, take your
right fingertips behind you.
Open up through your
right pec, right chest.
Now if you notice that
you're kind of collapsed
in the low back here,
it could be good to sit
up on a blanket or a block.
Finding length in the spine.
Then press into your left heel.
Take your left fingertips 
all the way up and
outer edge of the 
left elbow's gonna come to
the outer edge
of the right knee.
And find alignment
here in the twist.
Breathe, maybe look
past your right shoulder.
Inhale in.
Find that expansion
and then exhale.
Navel draws in.
Good, one more time, inhale in.
And exhale to release, awesome.
Take it to the other side.
Right arm reaches up.
When you're ready,
outer edge of the right elbow
to the outer edge
of the left thigh.
And a modification here could be
to just hug that left knee in
with the right elbow.
So providing the
spine now with some stretch.
Press into your right heel.
Lengthen through the
crown of the head, breathe in.
I love the sounds of the
birds outside my window here.
It's nice for
this moment anyway.
And then slowly release.
Take both feet out now.
Inhale, reach for
the sky as you exhale.
Think up and over as we come
into a deep stretch
for the hamstrings.
Bend your knees as much
as you need to here and
allow the weight
of the head to melt over.
Feeling that
stretch in the lower back.
Keep the toes
active here if you can.
Soften the skin of the face and
in time you might 
work to come into
Paschimottanasana
with the knees,
with the legs,
excuse me, straight.
Soft bend in the knees.
And then slowly release.
We're gonna cross the ankles,
come into Sukhasana,
cross-legged position.
Bring your right
hand down to the earth.
Left fingertips
reach up and over.
Just a nice,
easy side body stretch here.
Breathe in.
Round through center and
take it to the other side.
And then one more
round on each side.
Round through center, 
to the right. Breathe in.
Round through center.
To the left.
We'll come back to center,
palms on the knees,
chin to chest,
slowly roll up,
stacking through the spine.
And then bring the right ear 
over the right shoulder.
And left ear over left shoulder.
You can soften your gaze 
or close your eyes here.
This is the end of the video
so taking a
couple quiet moments.
You can draw a couple circles
with the nose one way.
And then the other.
And then bring the
head back to center.
Draw the palms together.
And then inhale, lift the
thumbs up to the forehead here.
Relax your shoulders and just
find stillness for a moment.
Notice how you feel.
And we'll close with a final 
breath in through the nose.
And out through
the nose or mouth.
You can bow the
head if it feels good.
Nice work.
