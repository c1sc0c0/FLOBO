(5) Assisted Standing
Forward Bend
(Uttanasana)
(fig. 1):
• Stand with your back one foot from wall; feet are hip
distance apart.
• Let your buttocks touch the wall. Bend forward, hinging
at the hips. Bend knees slightly.
• Using both hands, reach back and pull the flesh of the
buttocks up and away from the sitting bones..
(fig. 2):
• Bend your arms at the elbows; take hold of each
elbow with the opposite hand. Hang.
• With each exhalation, allow your spine to lengthen and
release more.
