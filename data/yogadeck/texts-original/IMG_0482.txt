(23) Fish
(Matsyasana)
(fig. 1):
• Lie on your back, legs together, hands under buttocks,
palms down.
(fig. 2):
• Lift your upper body onto your elbows. Bend your
neck backward, resting the crown of your head on the
floor. Arch your back, legs are passive. Make sure your
weight is mainly on your elbows, not your neck.
• Hold for several breaths.
• Return! by pressing elbows into the floor. Gently lift
your head and lower your upper body.
I inhale Life's positive energy
and exhale negativity.
