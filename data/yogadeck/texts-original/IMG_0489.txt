(11) Kneeling Lunge
(Anjaneyasana)
• Kneel in "table position."
(fig. 1):
• Move right foot between hands, then slide it slightly
ahead of your hands.
• Shift forward until right knee is fully bent at right angle.
Make sure your ankle is directly under right knee.
(fig. 2):
• Make sure your shinbone is straight, knee directly over
ankle. Keep palms flat on the floor, or make fists and
rest on knuckles. Hang head forward.
• Breathe slowly; hold for 20 seconds to 2 minutes.
• Push on the floor with hands to gently move back and
out of the pose. Repeat on the left side.
My actions are purposeful
and my thoughts are clear.

NOTE: A great pose if you spend a lot of time sitting.
