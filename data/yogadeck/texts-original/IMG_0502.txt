'(b) Shrugs and Circles
(fig. 1):
• Sit in a comfortable position.
• Bring both shoulders up tightly toward your ears.
Exaggerate the shrug and accentuate the holding.
• Release quickly, letting your shoulders drop.
• Repeat a few times.
(fig. 2):
• Bend both elbows and lightly place your fingers on top
of your shoulders.
• Rotate your elbows as though drawing small circles on
the walls.
• Circle 5 times in one direction; reverse and make 5
circles the other way.
• Drop your arms. Breathe and focus on how relaxed
your neck and shoulders feel.
Benefits:
• Improves flexibility in the upper back, shoulders,
and arms
• Increases strength in the upper arms
• Releases tension in the neck and shoulder area
