(e) Leg Stretch
• Lie on your back, legs straight.
• Raise one leg. With both hands, grasp your leg at a
comfortable point-ankle or calf.
• Slowly pull your leg toward your chest. Don't strain.
• To increase the stretch, loop a tie or scarf over the sole
of your foot. Gently tug on the tie, bringing your leg
toward your chest.
* With each exhalation, try to bring your leg closer.
Don't force it; you'll only end up with sore muscles.
• If possible, keep your other leg straight on the floor.
• Hold for several relaxed breaths.
• Repeat with other leg.
Benefits:
• Stretches the muscles and tendons along the back of
the leg
• Prepares the lower body for more strenuous stretches
NOTE: We need to maintain suppleness as we age. Do this stretch regularly
and watch your flexibility improve.
