Spider
(Supta Padangusthasana)
Lie on your back, legs straight.

Bring your right knee to your chest. Place left hand
firmly on left thigh.

• Wrap thumb and forefinger of your right hand around
the big toe of your right foot. Inhale. Exhale and slowly
raise your head; look down at left foot. Straighten right
knee as much as possible and bring it as close to your
nose as you comfortably can. Keep left leg on floor,
heel extended.
• Hold for up to 20 seconds. Slowly lower right leg and
repeat on other side.
I acknowledge my ability
