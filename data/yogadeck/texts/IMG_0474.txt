Yoga Mudra
(Symbol of Yoga)
tig 1):
• Stand straight, feet parallel and hip-width apart. Clasp
your palms behind you, interlacing fingers.
Bend forward from your hips; back straight, face
forward
(fig. 2)
• With hands still clasped, let your arms fall forward as
far as possible without straining.
• Hold the pose for 6 counts.
• On an inhalation, rise slowly, letting your arms fall back
gently; head up.
• Release your hands.
I release all obstacles to
full and free expression.
Benefits:
• Loosens shoulders, arms, and spine
• Stretches the back of the thighs
• Improves posture and back problems
NOTE: Yoga Mudra (pronounced MOO-dra) is a symbolic gesture of Yoga, in
which the head surrenders to the heart.
