Neck Rolls
(Greeva Sanchalana)
• Sit with your back straight, head upright.

• Exhale and drop your head forward, chin toward chest.

• Slowly roll your left ear over your left shoulder. Hold
for a few breaths, allowing the right side of your neck
to release.

• Slowly drop your chin toward your chest and roll your
right ear over your right shoulder. Hold, allowing the
left side of your neck to release.
• Repeat once on both sides.
• Be sure your breath remains steady and your pace
slow.
Benefits:
• Lubricates and stretches the neck joints
• Relieves residual tension in the neck and shoulders
• Firms the chin and throat
NOTE: A simple and quick tension reducer. Don't worry about popping or
gritty noises; they subside with time.
