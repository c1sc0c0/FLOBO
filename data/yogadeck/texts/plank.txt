Plank
(Phalakasana)
• Kneel in "table position," with legs under hips and
arms under shoulders.

Focus on a spot at eye level. Inhale; simultaneously lift
right leg straight behind you and left arm straight in
front of you.
• Don't raise too high. Leg should be at hip level; arm
level with shoulder.
• Hold for a few breaths before lowering leg and arm.
• Repeat on opposite side.
