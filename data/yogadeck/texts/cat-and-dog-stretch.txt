Cat and Dog Stretch
(Bitilasana Marjaryasana Adho Mukha Svanasana Vinyasa)
• Kneel in "table position," with knees under hips and
arms beneath shoulders.
• Keep your back straight, your head facing forward.

• Exhale and drop your head and tailbone. Arch your
back, exhaling further and pulling your navel up
toward your spine. Imagine you are an angry cat.

• Inhale and raise your head and tailbone, letting your
abdomen drop toward the floor. Curve your back in a
swayback position. Look up to the ceiling. You are a
friendly dog.
• Alternate between cat and dog several times.
• Exaggerate the stretches as you inhale and exhale
deeply.
Benefits:
• Increases suppleness along the spine
• Improves circulation
• Stretches muscles along the back, neck, and arms
