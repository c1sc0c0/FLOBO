21) Half Shoulderstand
(Archa Sarvangásana)
Lie on your back, arms by your side, palms down.
Align your body.
(fig. 1)
• Bend your knees. Roll your hips up over your shoulders.
• Use your hands to support your back at the hips.
(fig. 2):
• Extend legs over your head at a comfortable angle.
Hold for several minutes.
Release by bending legs and slowly rolling back dawn.
• Rest in the Fish pose (23), a nice counterbalance.
• This is a great alternative to the full Shoulderstand (22).
Same benefits, less effort!
I allow my inner beauty
to shine forth.
Benefits:
• Improves blood flow to the brain and nourishes the
complexion
