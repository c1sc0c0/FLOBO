Tree.
(Vrikshasana)

• Stand erect, eyes focused on a single point.
• Shift your weight to one leg. Raise your other leg and place the sole of your foot on your standing thigh. If your leg slips, hold your ankle with one hand.
• Once balanced, hold your arms either above your head, straight out to the side, or with hands clasped in prayer position at the center of your chest.
• Count slowly to 10. Repeat on the other side. My foundation is firm, my being is flexible.

Benefits:.
• Improves the posture and elongates the spine.
• Strengthens the knees and ankles.
• Opens the groin.
• Helps with balance and centering.

NOTE: If keeping your balance is difficult, do the Tree pose lying on your back.
