Knee Hug
• Lie on your back.
• Bring both knees to your chest.
• Encircle your legs with both arms and grasp your fore-
arms or wrists. Lightly squeeze your legs.
Gently roll from side to side, massaging your back.
Move your head in the same direction as the roll.
• For a variation, place your hands on your knees, part
your knees slightly, and make slow circles with them;
massaging hips and sacrum into the floor.
• Allow your movements to be slow and lazy. Keep your
head on the floor at all times.
