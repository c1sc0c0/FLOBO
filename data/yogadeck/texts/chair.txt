Chair
(Utkatasana)
Stand with feet under hips, arms held straight ahead.
• Exhale and slowly lower your body into a squat position
as though sitting on a chair.
• Keep feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart, knees over
ankles.
• Gaze beyond your arms. Hold for a slow count of 10.
I allow Life's energy to
stream through me.
Benefits:
• Energizes the entire body
• Stretches the back of the legs and calves
• Strengthens the Achilles tendons, ankles, and thigh
muscles
NOTE: This is a great pose for a cold day. If you can't warm up, try a few
rounds of the Chair pose.
