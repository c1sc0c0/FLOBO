Bound Angle
(Baddha Konásana)
• Sit with your back straight. Place soles of feet together;
interlace fingers around toes.
• Roll shoulders down and away from ears.
• Lower knees toward the floor without forcing the
stretch.
• Breathe deeply into the stretch. Allow the groin muscles
to relax a little more with each exhalation. •
I receive goodness. I radiate
happiness. I am content.
Benefits:
• Provides an excellent stretch for the groin muscles
• Improves posture
• Increases suppleness in the tendons as well as the
muscles of the knees and hips
