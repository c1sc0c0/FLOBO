Proud Warrior

• Bend right knee, forming a right angle with your calf
and thigh; right thigh parallel to the floor. Turn head
and gaze over your right hand.

• Bend at the waist and bring the fingertips of your right
hand to the floor, outside your right foot. Extend your
left arm above your head, creating a straight line
between left hand and foot. Hold for several breaths.

your right leg. Repeat on the left side.
I am confident and focused, drawing
on my inner strength.
