Bent Knee Sitting Forward.
(Mahamudra)

Sit erect, legs extended. Fold one leg so that the sole of the foot presses high on the inside of the other thigh.

• Inhale while raising your arms overhead, palms facing each other.
• Exhale; bend toward outstretched thigh. Stop when your back begins to round. Grasp extended leg where you can without straining (at calf, ankle, or foot). If it helps, bend leg slightly.
• Relax. Breathe into the stretch.
• Repeat on other side.
