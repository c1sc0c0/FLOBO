Bridge
(Setu Bandhasana)

• Lie on your back, knees bent, feet near buttocks and
hip-width apart. If possible, touch heels with your
hands.
• Contract your buttocks; curl your pelvis toward the
ceiling, pressing your back into the floor.

• Slowly lift your lower, middle, and upper back; raise
hips to ceiling. Weight is on your shoulders and feet.

Relax.
I am vulnerable, I am strong. I can be
vulnerable because I am strong.
Benefits:

NOTE: Instead of touching your heels, you may also clasp your hands under
your raised buttocks.
