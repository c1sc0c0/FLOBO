- Hey everyone, what's up and
welcome to Yoga with Adriene.
I'm Adriene and today 
we have a big request,
this is yoga for climbers.
But also really great 
for anyone who's wanting
to do a little ditty 
to cultivate more balance,
coordination, 
flexibility, and stability.
Hop into something 
comfy, and let's get started.
(upbeat music)
Alrighty my friends, 
let's begin standing today
feet hip width apart.
Take a nice deep breath in,
and as you exhale, 
just let go of the day
or the morning thus far, 
relax your shoulders.
Let's really drop in 
to this time for yourself
whether you're a 
climber, or a non-climber,
let's use this time, 
really utilize this time
to cultivate a little balance
and to find what feels good.
So deep breath in again, 
stand up nice and tall,
and as you exhale just think
of a release, a letting go.
He totally just sighed.
Nice buddy, Benji's with us.
Big inhale,
and exhale.
And one more time, 
big full breath in,
and exhale, maybe 
relax your shoulders
just in case they're 
creeping up towards your ears.
Awesome, now to the neck.
We're just gonna drop 
one ear over one shoulder.
And feel a nice gentle release
in the side of the neck.
And then over to the other side.
And then you're just gonna go
back and forth on your own.
And you can pause 
there and breathe,
or you can keep 
the movement going.
We're just kind of 
coming into the moment
so that we can really 
maximize this time for ourself,
but also create 
efficient movement.
So, today's practice 
is about coordination,
and it's about moving 
from your center, your core.
So if your mind is 
kind of distracted,
you can start to just zero in
on the sensation of the neck,
the sound of your breath, 
maybe how you're
distributing your 
weight in the feet.
And then notice if you're kind
of locking out the legs here,
see if you can 
softly bend your knees.
Alright, sweet, then 
bring the head back to center.
We're just gonna nice 
and easy nod the head,
drop the chin to the chest,
and then look 
up towards the sky.
And now notice 
if you've lost your
nice, deep conscious breath.
And the thing about 
climbing, and I won't pretend
that I'm like some 
professional climber of course,
but I did talk to some of my
pals and do some research,
and the thing about 
climbing that I was noticing is,
the breath, a lot of times
when we get into this focused
scenario, or when we're 
trying to hold our balance,
and we see this in yoga all
the time, we hold our breath.
Alright, bring the head
back to center and here we go.
We're gonna send the 
fingertips up towards the sky.
Big inhale as you stretch, 
reach way up high,
and then exhale to float it
down, wiggle the fingertips,
really open up through 
the pecs and the chest.
So again, 
maximize this movement,
see how efficient you can be.
Instead of just 
inhaling while you reach up,
exhale come down, because 
that's what we do in yoga,
see if you can really get the
most out of your movement,
nice and in control, so big
inhale, then reach for the sky,
and exhale, 
opening through the chest,
float the fingertips down.
Now you know what 
you're doing, or somewhat,
so you can take your 
eyes off the video, off me,
and really start to 
maybe integrate the neck,
so the nodding movement 
that we did, chin to chest,
and then big inhale to 
look up towards the sky.
And I start to really 
sync up with my breath here,
find length through all 
four sides of the torso.
See if you can 
distribute your weight evenly
through the soles of your feet.
(laughing) Benji, man.
And let's do one 
more big full breath,
inhale, why not, lots of 
love in, reach for the sky.
And exhale, why not, 
exhale lots of love out.
Bring it down, all right.
Interlace the fingertips
behind the back, sorry buddy.
We're gonna interlace, draw
the knuckles down and away.
Title of my 
second book, I told you,
one day I'm gonna write it.
And lift the chest here.
Now pause, see if you can 
lengthen your tailbone down
and bring your belly button in,
and then head over heart, 
heart over pelvis here.
Breathe deep.
If you're kind of 
craving a little more here,
see if you can bring the palms
together, really together.
And if that's not 
happening for your body
just breathe deep and let it
unfold, don't force or press.
So nice and open through 
the chest, pecs, collarbone,
breathe deep.
Fab, then bend the 
knees, generously inhale,
smile a little bit, 
why not, life's too short,
and then exhale, 
draw your navel in
and we're gonna draw a 
big rainbow with the knuckles
all the way up 
towards the ceiling or the sky
and then maybe 
over past the head.
So this'll be 
different for everyone.
You may get here, you might
get belly towards the thighs.
And then if you can, relax
the weight of your head down
and breathe a little deeper.
We're here for five, 
inhale lots of love in,
three, exhale lots of 
love out, and then here we go
on the one, dig into 
the heels and you're gonna
slowly roll it up, 
keep the fingers interlaced.
Roll it up, 
press into your feet,
and then break free the chains
(exaggerating exhale) 
Mountain Pose.
Now, stay 
present here, in control.
Feel that sensation, 
that flush of
fresh blood.
Ah.
Nice, and we'll take 
the fingertips forward,
right arm over the left, just
give yourself a big hug here.
So your fingertips 
are gonna kind of come in
towards the center of your back,
and then you're gonna lift
your elbows, inhale and exhale.
Awesome, same thing, this 
time opposite thumb on top,
so reach behind, 
opposite thumb comes on top
as you interlace, 
knuckles draw down and away,
so the shoulder blades 
come in towards each other
and we stand up 
nice and tall, breathe.
Maybe the palms come together.
Lengthen tailbone down, 
so there's a gentle kind of
lengthening of 
the tailbone down.
You know, like this.
I hate to say tuck 
of the pelvis because
that's a little 
old school now, people,
it creates compression 
so, just lengthen it down,
just experiment, 
and then here we go,
same thing when 
you're ready, bend the knees
and we start to take it forward.
So keep reaching the knuckles
way up high towards the sky,
and then check out how 
it is for your body today.
Every time you come 
to practice on the mat
stay present in 
the existing narrative.
So your hamstrings 
some days, well every day,
hamstrings are the 
exception, they're always tight.
Relax the weight of the 
head over, breathe deep.
But really be present in 
the sensation of your body.
Maybe it's different 
because of a workout,
because of travel, 
because of something emotional,
because of something you ate.
So it's worth it to 
really make the practice
about being present rather than
what you think you 
know about your body.
Dig into the heels, we're
here for five, breathe deep,
four,
three,
two, stick with me, 
nice and in control,
that's the name 
of the game today.
Press into the heels, 
engage the inner thighs
as you roll up.
And if you're shaking 
or a little trembly here,
that's the ticket.
Sometimes it's not 
what we do but how we do it,
the way in which 
we do it, here we go,
break free the chains 
(exaggerating exhale).
Mountain Pose, go ahead 
and open the palms forward.
Creaky floor.
And then lift up 
from the armpit chest.
And if you need 
a little movement,
rotation in the 
wrists or anything here,
of course feel free to take it.
(sighing)
Awesome, let's bring the 
hands together at the heart.
You're gonna actively 
press the palms together here.
Beautiful, and then 
send the fingertips forward,
this time left arm over,
just give yourself a big hug.
You're gonna try to 
inch the fingers behind
the center of 
your back one more time
and inhale, lift the elbow,
and then exhale 
let it all go, awesome.
Inhale, reach for the sky.
And then all the way down 
on an exhale, Forward Fold.
Awesome work.
Inhale halfway lift, 
nice flat back position.
Exhale fold all the way down.
Inhale to reach for 
the sky, you got this,
big stretch, big breath.
And exhale hands to heart, 
lengthen tailbone down.
So start to tap into a 
longer, smoother breath.
So if you're new to the practice
or if it seems 
really arduous, no problem
just keep returning to 
the sound of your breath
and see if you can 
really kind of keep that
as your number one 
goal, your number one,
not goal but 
focus, that's nicer.
Okay, we're gonna shift 
our weight to the left foot.
We're gonna 
grab the right ankle,
just a nice quad stretch here.
Use this left thumb 
to lift your sternum
and then see if you can lengthen
the tailbone down a bit here.
Breathing deep. (exhaling)
Awesome, then slowly release,
palms come together, namaste.
Shift to the right foot 
and now we're gonna catch
the left ankle, again 
use your right thumb here
to lift your chest up, 
so if you're collapsing here
it's gonna be a 
little bit tricky.
So squeeze into the 
midline, lift your heart,
lift your chest and breathe.
Quad stretch, 
nice front hip stretch.
Lengthening tailbone down
instead of letting it tip out.
Awesome, then one more breath,
using exhale to release.
Gorgeous, here we go, 
press the palms together.
So really, really activate, 
press elbows, excuse me,
send elbows out left to right
as you press into your knuckles.
(clicking tongue and exhaling)
Awesome, then release, 
inhale, reach for the sky.
Exhale Forward Fold, 
all the way down.
Inhale halfway 
lift, your version,
just find length in your neck.
And exhale fold.
Great, root to rise here,
inhale and reach 
for the sky, you got it.
And exhale hands to heart.
All right.
Step the feet hip width apart
if they are not already.
I'm gonna step on Benji's 
ear and then they're gonna
call the animal police.
And then we're gonna 
shift our weight again
over to the left foot.
And then you're gonna 
take your right toes out,
and we're gonna squeeze 
everything into the midline.
If you're familiar with this
kind of navel lock, core lock,
we call it Uddiyana Bundha,
we'll do a video just on that.
But we're just gonna 
kind of draw the navel
in and up a little bit, 
just experiment with that.
So we're activating 
the core, all right.
And then we're gonna keep 
the palms pressing together
so we've kind of 
activated all of these things
to maybe lift the 
right toe off the ground.
And if that's like whoa, 
no, then we'll just kind of
work maybe with 
one breath at a time.
But if you can stay there and
breathe, let's give it a go.
You can flex the 
foot or point the toe.
And then we're gonna 
bring a little soft bend
to that left knee so 
we're not locked out here.
Glutes turn on, 
navel's activated,
core's activated, 
navel's drawing in.
Neck is nice and 
long, chest is lifted.
And then if you're 
here and you're starting to
sweat bullets, breathe.
And if you're here 
and you feel pretty good,
like I've got this 
Adriene, what else you got?
Then slowly send the 
left fingertips up high,
and then exhale, we're gonna
go left elbow to right knee,
squeeze everything in.
Let's give it a go, 
inhale to find extension
and exhale, squeeze in.
Now, we can take the 
right fingertips out now,
inhale expand, 
have some fun with it.
Exhale, bring everything in.
Inhale, expand.
And exhale bring everything in.
Let's do three more, 
moving with your breath, inhale.
Exhale, nice and slow, 
controlled movement.
Inhale, whoa my left 
glute is really turning on,
and then, in and 
let's do one more.
Inhale, spread the fingers, 
spread the toes,
smile, life is good.
And then here we go, 
from the navel,
everything into the center 
(exaggerating exhale)
and then release.
Plant your feet firmly, 
bring the palms together,
elbows left to right. (exhaling)
Inhale
and exhale.
Shift your weight 
over to your right foot.
Left toe comes to the ground.
So you can really work 
here, so if your body's tired,
or maybe again, you're 
kind of new to practice here,
starting this practice because
you want to create more
balance and 
coordination in the body,
give yourself a 
break man, like if the leg
isn't coming up, 
squeeze, engaging the thighs
and work here, and just work
little baby moments here,
engaging all the right muscles
so that you're creating
support rather than kind of
faking it 'til you make it.
This is the one place 
that that doesn't really jive
I think, in my opinion.
In my other 
career it's (laughing),
in every other area of my
life fake it 'til you make it
works, but not 
on the yoga mat so
softly bend that right knee,
and maybe you're here already.
Just checking it out, all right.
Especially if you're 
a climber, you know how
the left and the right 
side can be very different.
So honor that in 
your body and make sure
you're not holding your breath.
And if you're ready, 
let's send the right fingertips
all the way out, 
kind of like an arabesque.
And then exhale, reel 
everything in, navel in,
try to really 
move from your center.
And then inhale, there's a
tendency to wanna rush this
so keep it nice and 
slow and controlled.
And then exhale, 
squeeze everything in.
Inhale, maybe we 
add the left arm.
And moving with 
the breath, exhale.
Inhale
and exhale.
All right, three more, 
don't rush it.
Inhale,
exhale.
Inhale, the belly grows 
long, like a puppy's belly.
And on the exhale 
the upper abdominals
and the lower belly 
kind of come in together.
(exaggerating exhale)
And one more, we 
got this, inhale.
And exhale, we rock, 
all right release.
Both feet come 
evenly to the earth.
Palms come together, 
deep breath in.
Relax your shoulders as 
you breathe out, beautiful.
Big inhale to reach for the sky.
Exhale to rain it all the
way down again, Forward Fold.
Inhale halfway lift,
and exhale fold.
All right, from here we're
gonna slowly walk the hands out
and then slowly 
walk the feet out
and you're gonna 
come into a Plank Pose.
Then you're gonna really tap
into a strong breath here,
the strongest breath 
you've taken all day.
And really press 
through the fingertips
to take pressure 
out of the wrists.
Claw, claw, claw 
through the fingertips
to take pressure 
out of the wrists.
Then shine your elbow 
creases towards the front,
reach your heels back, 
and we're wanting to create
one nice long line 
from the crown to the tail.
Breathe deep, press 
away from your yoga mat.
If your hips are 
dropping, lift 'em up,
if your shoulder 
blades are dropping,
lift up through the 
center of your back.
We're here for five, you got it,
four, three, two, bend the
knees, lift the hips up high,
keep clawing 
through the fingertips.
Downward Facing Dog.
Breathe, breathe, 
breathe, pedal it out.
Keep clawing 
through the fingertips.
Oh, we have two 
down dogs here today.
Alright, here we go, 
take one more deep breath in.
And long breath out.
Then inhale, lift 
your right leg up high,
and exhale knee to third eye.
Squeeze and lift, 
squeeze and lift.
All right, then you're done.
Step the right 
foot all the way up,
you're gonna drop the left knee.
Then you're gonna 
walk the right fingertips
in towards your right big toe.
So both palms are 
together and then we're gonna
turn the left toes out, 
so your kind of coming into
a little half 
extended side angle here.
And then we're 
gonna slowly, slowly open
all the way up towards 
the sky but nice and slow.
So really working this from the
ground up reach for the sky.
And if you need a little lift
here, go ahead and find it.
Come on to the fingertips
or even elbow to 
the top of the thigh.
We're wanting to find 
this expansion in the chest
and then still keep this
connection to 
our core, our center.
Breathe deep, pressing 
the top of your left foot.
You should feel an 
awesome stretch in the IT,
and the outer hip.
Lengthen tailbone down, 
just like we've been doing.
So if it's been coming out
here, see if you can bring it in
to the center line.
And then let's 
wiggle the left fingertips,
make sure we're having 
a full body experience,
lengthen through the crown.
And then bring it all 
the way down, awesome.
Go ahead and frame your right
foot, bring you left toes back
and then just pull it back
here, a nice runner's stretch.
Flex your rights toes 
towards your third eye.
Keep a nice bend 
in your right knee.
Breathe deep.
Alright, then we'll 
roll through the right foot.
We're gonna plant the palms,
curl the back toes under,
step it back to that plank.
So, see if you can 
maintain nice full breaths
while you refine 
a little bit here.
See if you can lift the front
body up to meet the back body.
Lengthen through the crown.
We're firing up through 
the muscles of the core,
reaching the heels back, 
lifting the knee caps
up towards the sky, 
breathing deep.
We're here for five, 
claw through the fingertips,
four,
three,
two, slow and with 
control, bend the knees,
draw the navel in and up, 
send the hips high.
Downward Facing Dog, awesome.
Take a deep breath in, 
and a long breath out.
Maybe shake the head loose
here, maybe walk your dog out
to be a little bit wider.
There's a tendency 
lately I've been seeing a lot
for the hands to 
be really narrow.
So, especially for today's
practice, walk the hands out,
shine your 
elbow creases forward.
Sweet here we go, big inhale 
to lift the left leg up high.
Exhale nice and slow 
and in control today, guys.
Roll through and 
we're gonna squeeze
knee towards the third eye,
through the 
center of your brows.
Here we go, 
five, four, three, two,
and step it up, awesome 
work, lower the back knee.
Take a second to find 
that deep conscious breath.
Awesome, then we're 
gonna walk the left fingertips
in towards your left big toe.
And then take your time.
Gaining a little 
coordination sometimes
if this is new stuff 
for you, new material,
new vocabulary that 
is, it takes some time
so just move nice and slow.
You're gonna take the right toes
over towards the 
left side of the mat.
This is still part 
of your foundation.
Then lengthen 
tailbone down and in.
Activate the upper back body.
And when you're ready, open
right fingertips to the sky.
Find that expansion, breathe.
Lift the tailbone, the 
coccyx is kind of coming out.
See if you can hug 
it in, breathing deep.
And if you need some 
space, just come on to the top
of that left thigh 
with your left elbow.
Inhale and exhale.
Draw the 
shoulder blades together.
One more breath as you inhale.
Maybe wiggle the 
right fingertips,
lengthen through the crown.
And exhale to bring 
everything back, awesome.
Frame the left foot, 
bring the right toes back.
Here we go, pulling back 
through the left hip crease.
So keep that 
bend in the left knee.
This helps us really 
stretch the meat, the middle,
the belly of that hamstring
and not just where they attach.
Which is awesome, for 
everyone, not just climbers.
(exhaling) My precious.
My precious.
Okay, dig into your left foot,
let's find a 
little articulation.
Pay attention to the 
nuance of every move.
So important for climbers.
So same thing here, 
don't just shift forward
but really dig into that foot,
find the grammar of the foot,
as they say.
And then we'll plant the palms.
And one last time, 
we got this, here we go.
Plank Pose.
Breathe deep, 
so really important,
if the shoulder 
blades are collapsing here,
claw through the fingertips
and dome up through 
the upper back body.
Think about your shoulder
blades going left and right.
You can even overdo 
it a little bit today
to really find that sensation.
Awesome, beautiful.
We're gonna slowly now shift
to the knees, nice and slow.
We're gonna take the right hand
and bring it right to 
the center of the mat.
And then nice and slow we're
gonna turn the right toes out
and we're gonna open up to a
little gate variation here.
So you'll open up 
kind of the way we did
in that half Extended Side Angle
and send the left 
fingertips towards the sky.
So we're doing a 
modified Half Moon today.
Stacking the shoulders.
And so the way that 
we'll activate the modified
Half Moon is by 
bringing the upper abdominals
and lower belly together.
And then engaging 
the left inner thigh
and lifting the left foot up.
See if you can keep 
your left toes turned in
as opposed to out.
And we're breathing 
deep here. (exhaling)
Notice I'm keeping 
the extension of my neck,
so nice and long.
And maybe I turn up to look
up towards my left fingertips.
And I wiggle the left 
fingertips and then slow
and with control, bring the
left foot down, right hand down.
And come back to all 
fours, Tabletop Position.
Beautiful, other side, 
left hand comes to the center.
Take your time, press 
away from your yoga mat,
claw through your 
fingertips so you're not putting
a bunch of 
pressure in your wrists.
Sweet, then we're 
gonna take the left toes out
and here we go, 
keep breathing here
as you move into 
this gate variation.
So we open up and the 
right foot really roots down
to start here just so you 
can build your foundation.
And then I reach up.
And then maybe my 
whole body's lit up here
and I'm breathing, 
I'm lengthening my tailbone
towards my right heel.
I'm feeling awesome, 
so I just stay here.
Or I try that modified Half Moon
by engaging my core 
and the right inner thigh,
pressing into my foundation
and lifting that 
right leg up high.
Gonna turn on 
that outer hip here.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Remember the neck is 
an extension of the spine
so equidistant between 
each earlobe and shoulder.
Breathe, wiggle 
the right fingertips,
maybe lift your 
right leg a little higher.
And then soften with control, 
bring everything down.
Come back to that 
Tabletop Position.
Awesome, inhale, look forward.
And exhale, Child's Pose.
Awesome, bring the 
knees wide, big toes to touch
or toes come in 
towards the center
and just melt your heart 
here, melt your forehead.
Inhale deeply.
And exhale and everything go.
So keep the 
lower body where it is,
we're just gonna lift the chest.
You wanna slide the 
right hand underneath
and thread the needle.
So right fingertips 
come in and underneath
the bridge of your left arm.
You're just gonna turn, 
you can lift the hips up high
to get a deeper stretch.
And if you need a 
little more you can create
a little resistance by 
bending your left elbow.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
(breathing deeply)
Nice, then slowly 
come back to center.
Same thing on the other side,
left fingertips slide in.
So the bum really lifts up so
you can get a deeper stretch
here and create 
more flexibility.
And if you're 
craving a little more
you can use that right hand
to press the right elbow up.
See if you can keep (mumbles)
consciousness in the feet.
Breathe deep.
Awesome, try to move 
from your center, your core,
even here as you 
come back, unravel.
Awesome, then 
we'll walk the knees in
underneath the hip points.
We'll cross one ankle 
over the other, any ankle.
And then use your hands to
walk it all the way through.
You're gonna send the 
legs out in front of you.
Sorry buddy.
Paschimottanasana here we go,
bend the knees a little bit,
sit up nice and tall, toes are
pointing up towards the sky.
Inhale, reach the 
fingertips up high.
And then exhale, 
think up and over,
draw your navel in and up.
And if your belly is 
kind of in the way there,
welcome to the club.
Just be loving, loving, loving.
Think about activating 
and working for yourself
rather than oh man, 
my belly's in the way
I can't do this pose.
Right, drop the pose
and then find the sensation
that feels really awesome, 
feels really good for you.
So bow your head down.
If you are working on 
straightening legs, awesome,
you do that, if you're 
here and this is like
oh amazing for your back.
So some people will be 
working more on flexibility,
some people will be aiming more
for that controlled movement.
The fact of the 
matter is, it's all good.
This time, however 
you choose to spend it,
is time well spent if 
it's with your breath,
cultivating some mindfulness.
(exhaling)
And some love for your body.
We'll take one 
final breath here.
I encourage you 
to close your eyes.
Just go inward for a second, 
notice what's going on,
what thoughts are coming up.
(breathing deeply)
Sweet, then we'll slowly release
and same thing, with 
control, slowly roll it up.
Head is the last 
thing to lift up high.
Fabulous, and then this is
gonna be yogi's choice today.
You can cross the ankles and
come to end your practice
today in a nice meditation pose,
or you can begin to lay down.
Maybe you're doing this 
on the Find What Feels Good
membership so a video 
won't pop up right away.
So you choose
how to want to 
end your practice.
And then we'll all just bring
our hands to the heart center.
So if you're on 
your back you can take
one hand on the heart 
and one hand on the belly.
And if you're 
seated up tall like me
you can bring the 
palms together, Anjali Mudra.
Alright, take a second 
to appreciate yourself,
this time that you took
for mind and body.
And then send some 
love out to all the people
all over the world 
practicing this with us.
Every person, every pet.
And any other spirits that
might be practicing with us.
To all the climbers, to all
the wanna be climbers like me,
and to this valuable 
time to just cultivate balance
and flexibility in 
the body, you rock.
Here we go, bring the 
thumbs up to the third eye
and take a deep breath in.
And as you exhale 
bow, head to heart.
We say, namaste.
(upbeat music)
