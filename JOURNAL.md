# Development Journal

* 2024-06-01: Setup initial infrastructure: Jupyter + ChromaDB + CLIPS, let's forget about building a web UI for now.
* 2024-06-02: Super naive implementation done. Need to focus on defining clear inputs, outputs & data sanitization next.

# Brainstorming

## Input

 * Do we need to do entity extraction on the input? 
 
    Can you please share your age?
    Have you practiced yoga before? If so, for how long?
    What is your current experience level with yoga (beginner, intermediate, advanced)?
    Do you have any injuries or medical conditions that I should be aware of?
    Are there any physical limitations or restrictions I should consider (e.g., pregnancy, recent surgery, chronic pain)?
    What are your main goals for this session (e.g., relaxation, strength, flexibility, stress relief)?
    Are there specific areas of the body or types of poses you would like to focus on (e.g., backbends, hip openers, inversions)?
    Do you prefer a more dynamic (vinyasa) or static (hatha) practice?
    How long should the flow be?
    Do you have a preferred yoga style (e.g., Ashtanga, Yin, Restorative)?
    Would you like to include meditation or pranayama (breathing exercises)?
    Where will you be exercising (e.g., studio, outdoor, online)?
    What equipment will you have available (e.g., yoga mats, blocks, straps, blankets)?
