      "What a great question!\n",
      "\n",
      "The short answer is: scattering of light by tiny particles in the atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light (around 400-700 nanometers), so they don't absorb or reflect light significantly. However, they do scatter the light in all directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scattering effect is more pronounced for shorter wavelengths, like blue and violet light, which are scattered more than longer wavelengths, like red and orange light. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result of this scattering, our eyes perceive the blue light that's being scattered in all directions from the sun, giving the sky its blue appearance. The color we see is actually a combination of the direct sunlight and the scattered blue light.\n",
      "\n",
      "The intensity of the blue color depends on various factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Time of day**: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, scattering more blue light and making the sky appear more reddish.\n",
      "2. **Atmospheric conditions**: Dust, pollution, and water vapor can scatter shorter wavelengths like blue light more efficiently, making the sky appear less blue or even hazy.\n",
      "3. **Altitude and atmospheric pressure**: Changes in altitude and atmospheric pressure can affect the amount of scattering that occurs, influencing the sky's color.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny molecules in the atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths like blue light being scattered more than longer wavelengths like red light."
