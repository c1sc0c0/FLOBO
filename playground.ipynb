    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "1) A set of yoga poses made with OCR from 50 cards from a Yoga Deck. The deck was scanned, then OCR'd.\n",
    "2) Initial poses augmented wiht yoga poses crawled from websites like pocketyoga.com and yogajournal.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A single Markdown document with a description for each pose.\n",
    "* A set of transition rules to go from one pose to another.\n",
    "* A set of benefit and counter-indication rules.\n",
    "* A set of flow construction rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Markdown for the individual documents.\n",
    "* CLIPS / RDF / OWL for the rules and facts. RDF/OWL more popular. Currently no tools to convert between the formats. CLIPS seems better suited for our use case. Our own DSL?\n",

    "* Input: .HEIC picture of each yoga deck card.\n",
    "* Processing: convert to png, grayscale, invert, increase contrast with ImageMagick\n",
    "* OCR: convert to text with VNRecognizeTextRequest from MacOS Vision Framework. Tesseract gave bad results.\n",
    "* LLM Correction: amazingly GPT was able to \"fix\" Tesseract's bad OCR full of diacretics.\n",
